# Evidence Model

This repo uses an evidence-first structure:

1) Define a stable audit boundary using an Audit Object (AO) inventory.
2) Bind each threat statement to:
   - Preconditions
   - Required evidence types and specific evidence instances
   - Expected controls and verification activities
3) Package outputs into an audit bundle that is re-appraisable under drift.
